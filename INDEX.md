## 💡 Key Takeaways

### The Vision
**Dhanaadhya** = "Wealth & Prosperity"  
Gamified business simulation helping Indian newbie entrepreneurs learn MSME skills in safe sandbox before investing ₹1-10 lakh.

### The Problem
60% of new MSMEs fail in first 3 years because:
- Founders don't know what to focus on daily/weekly/monthly
- Tax & compliance surprises them
- They invest before understanding the business
- No operational playbooks exist

### The Solution
✓ Learn how to run 10+ types of businesses  
✓ Understand real tax/compliance (GST, income tax, etc.)  
✓ Get daily/weekly/monthly guidance on what matters  
✓ Simulate 1+ years safely  
✓ See consequences of decisions  

### The Market
- TAM: ₹100-200 Crore
- Users/year: 40 lakh new MSMEs
- Unit economics: 36x LTV/CAC (excellent!)
- Addressable: 2-3 million serious learners/year

### The Go-To-Market
- **Free tier**: Acquire users
- **Premium**: ₹99/month (experts, advanced features)
- **B2B**: Government, NGOs, schools (bulk licensing)

### The Roadmap
**Priority 1 (Critical)**: Onboarding, Failure recovery, Real-world bridge, Support  
**Priority 2 (Must-have)**: Content, Premium tiers, B2B, Analytics  
**Priority 3 (Should-have)**: Personalization, Regional, Replayability, Community  
**Priority 4 (Nice-to-have)**: Privacy, Localization, Mental health resources

## 🎯 Recommended Next Action

Choose one:

**Option A: Validate Idea** (Do this first!)
- Interview 20 newbie entrepreneurs
- Ask: "Would you use this? What would you pay?"
- Risk: Discover users don't want this (better to know now)
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Decision: Go / No-Go

**Option B: Raise Capital**
- Use business_model.dot + README.md for pitch
- Show investors 36x LTV/CAC ratio
- Raise ₹50-100L for MVP development
- Risk: Founders dilution
- Time: 2-4 weeks
- Decision: Funded / Rejected

**Option C: Build MVP**
- Hire 2-3 engineers
- Start with 1 business type (Kirana)
- 4-month sprint to alpha
- Risk: Building wrong product
- Time: 4-6 months
- Decision: Pivot / Double-down

**Recommendation**: Do A first (validation), then B (capital), then C (build).
